  abstract = {Programming in Scala is the definitive book on Scala, the new language for the Java Platform that blends object-oriented and functional programming concepts into a unique and powerful tool for developers. Coauthored by the designer of the Scala language, this authoritative book will teach you, one step at a time, the Scala language and the ideas behind it. The book is carefully crafted to help you learn. The first few chapters will give you enough of the basics that you can already start using Scala for simple tasks. The entire book is organized so that each new concept builds on concepts that came before - a series of steps that promises to help you master the Scala language and the important ideas about programming that Scala embodies. A comprehensive tutorial and reference for Scala, this book covers the entire language and important libraries.},

  title = {A {{Nominal Theory}} of {{Objects}} with {{Dependent Types}}},
  isbn = {978-3-540-45070-2},
  abstract = {We design and study vObj, a calculus and dependent type system for objects and classes which can have types as members. Type members can be aliases, abstract types, or new types. The type system can model the essential concepts of JAVA's inner classes as well as virtual types and family polymorphism found in BETA or GBETA. It can also model most concepts of SML-style module systems, including sharing constraints and higher-order functors, but excluding applicative functors. The type system can thus be used as a basis for unifying concepts that so far existed in parallel in advanced object systems and in module systems. The paper presents results on confluence of the calculus, soundness of the type system, and undecidability of type checking.},
